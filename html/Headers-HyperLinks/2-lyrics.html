        This is my song
        And no one can take it away
        It's been so long
        But now you're here
        Here to stay

        And I wonder
        If you know what it means
        To find your dreams come true

        This is my song
        And no one can make it a lie
        It's been so long
        Since someone
        Could make me cry

        And I wonder
        If you know what it means
        To laugh as tears go by
        I may not always sing in tune
        And sometimes you don't hear me
        But you don't have to be near me
        To know that I'm singing

        This is my song
        And nothing can make it die
        It's been so long
        And it's stronger, I know why
        And I wonder

        If you really, really know
        That as long as I live
        I will sing my song for you
        I may not always sing in tune
        
        And sometimes you don't hear me
        But you don't have to be near me
        To know that I'm singing
        This is my song

        And nothing can make it die
        It's been so long
        And it's stronger, I know why
        And I wonder

        If you really, really know
        That as long as I live

        I will sing my song
        That as long as I live
        I will sing my song

        That as long as I live
        I will sing my song for you
